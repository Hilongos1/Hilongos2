        <li>[Verse 1: Chris Martin]<br>
                      Look at the stars<br>
                      Look how they shine for you<br>
                      And everything you do<br>
                     Yeah, they were all yellow<br>
                      I came along<br>
                     <span style="color:#14A3C7;font-weight:bold"> I wrote a song for you<br>
                     And all the things you do</span><br>
                     And it was called Yellow<br>
                     So then I took my turn<br>
                     Oh, what a thing to have done<br>
                    And it was all yellow</li><br>

                       (Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, <br>
                       your skin and bones<br>
                       (Ooh) <span style="color:#14A3C7;font-weight:bold">Turn into something beautiful<br>

         <li>[Verse 2: Chris Martin]<br> 
                      I swam across<br>
                      I jumped across for you<br>
                     Oh, what a thing to do<br>
                     Cause you were all yellow<br>
                     I drew a line<br>
                     I drew a line for you<br>
                     Oh, what a thing to do<br>
                     And it was all yellow</li> <br>
